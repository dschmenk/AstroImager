This is the interface library for the USB Starlight Xpress cameras.

The Windows DLL is from the latest SX SDK. You may have to install the Microsfot Visual C++ runtime in order for it to run: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555

Linux and Mac build a compatible library from source. Linux should install the udev rules.d to allow usermode access to the USB cameras.

All versions share a common include file.
