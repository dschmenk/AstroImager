# Drift Scan Image Reduction

Although traditional steps in astronomical image reduction don't directly apply, drift scanning actually makes the process a little easier. Since the image is scanned across the entire image sensor, it becomes a 1D operation instead of a 2D operation. The raw drift scan will have discrepancies in each column: the accumulation of hot-pixels and slight sensitivities summed up for the column. So it needs a 1D flat field (flat row?). What's interesting about drift scanning, is we can statistically calculate this from the image itself. The idea is to find the median value for the entire scan which will be used as the global background value. Each column's median value will be used to scale the column's pixels so that the new background value will match the global background value. 8th grade algebra and we have a simple equation to apply over a massive data set.

The tools (hardware and software) that are now available to the amateur astronomer are amazing. 20 years ago this was a real challenge to deal with this amount of data. It's easy to generate a 500 MB scan. Operating over this amount of data using tools available from [AstroPy](https://www.astropy.org) makes this a breeze. AstroPy is a nice project that combines other existing projects into a package targeted at manipulating images in FITS files. Using a computer with 8 GB of memory doesn't even skip a beat with a measly 1 GB dataset (floating point pixels). My little script based off the tutorials found on the AstroPy and NumPy web pages quickly got me this result using one of my early test scans (before on left, after on right):
